PHP Conditional Assignment Operators
The PHP conditional assignment operators are used to set a value depending on conditions:


?:	Ternary	$x = expr1 ? expr2 : expr3	Returns the value of $x.
The value of $x is expr2 if expr1 = TRUE.
The value of $x is expr3 if expr1 = FALSE	

??	Null coalescing	$x = expr1 ?? expr2	Returns the value of $x.
The value of $x is expr1 if expr1 exists, and is not NULL.
If expr1 does not exist, or is NULL, the value of $x is expr2.
Introduced in PHP 7
